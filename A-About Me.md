		<p>I’m Sepehr Samavati, a person of many things. I got my bachelor’s degree in Iran from the University of Tehran and my master’s from Politecnico di Milano in Italy. I’ve been working as a software engineer for the past three years, contributing to projects at 7SangTeam, HCLTech, and Ericsson.</p>
		<p>While my career is currently focused on embedded software development, that doesn’t stop me from diving into other fields. I consider myself strong in algorithms, optimization, and software design. And even though I’m following the engineering path right now, I know that leadership is where I truly belong. It has always been my passion, and it’s what people know me for.</p>
		<p>Beyond my career, I have a deep interest in photography. I’m constantly learning and exploring my own style, with the goal of becoming a professional. I love capturing photos that tell a story through contrast or deeper meaning.</p>
		<p>In my personal life, I enjoy hanging out with friends and meeting new people. When it comes to sports, I like hiking, volleyball, and ping pong. I’m also a pretty good cook, and I love playing video games in my free time.</p>
