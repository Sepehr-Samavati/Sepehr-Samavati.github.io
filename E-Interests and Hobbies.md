					<h3>Sport Activities</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I love staying active. I have a regular running routine and enjoy playing volleyball and ping pong—both playing and watching. And last but not least, I love hiking. Spending time in nature, whether in the mountains or on hiking trails, is something I truly enjoy. It’s even better when I can capture some great photos along the way.</p>

					<h3>Cooking</h3>

				<p>Cooking is something I’m really passionate about. I can cook most Persian dishes really well, and recently, I’ve been learning Italian and Mexican recipes too. I also took some online baking courses and plan to continue improving my skills. </p>

					<h3>Games</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I love playing video games, both solo and with friends. My main game is Dota 2, which I enjoy for its strategy and teamwork. Besides video games, I’m a big fan of board games and enjoy game nights with friends, whether it’s casual fun or a more strategic challenge.</p>
